# PROS Autonomous Shell

A scripting shell intended for writing autonomous programs for PROS

## NOTE: This library is very new and is not yet functional


Goals for what the user will be able to do:

- Type commands into the PROS terminal to prototype autonomous programs
- Run commands from any other stream, such as a file from the SD card
- Use built-in bindings for popular libraries such as ARMS, LemLib, Okapi, and EZ
- Add custom commands to interface with their own libraries
