These are the commands that will be for ARMS command

goto <position> (optional args)
    Moves the robot to an absolute position

    Position:
        number:             Moves the robot forward or backward by an amount
        (num, num):         Moves the robot to a point on the field
        (num, num, num):    Moves the robot a pose on the field using the boomerang controller

    Optional Parameters
        nopid, thru:        Move without PID
        pid=(num,num,num)   Set the PID constants to use for this movement
        pi=(num, num)       Set PI for this command
        pd=(num, num)       Set PD for this command
        id=(num, num)       Set ID for this comand
        p=num               Set P for this movement
        i=num               set I for this movement
        d=num               set D for this movement

        async               Do not wait for the robot to settle before continuing execution

        relative, rel       Move relative to the robots current position, rather than globally

        boomerang           move using the boomerang controller
        ponitThenPose       move using the point-to-pose controller

        reverse             Move with the robot in reverse

        exitRadius          Sets the maximum radius to that counts the robot as settled
        exitAngle           Sets the maximum angle that counts for angular settlement

        maxSpeed            Sets the maximum speed for the robot

move <position/pose> [Optional Parameters] 
    The same thing as the goto command, except with the relative flag is set


face <angle/point> [optional parameters]
    Makes the robot face a specific angle, or face a specific point in space.

    Angle       - The angle to face
    Point       - The point on the field to face

    Optional args:
        relative            Face the angle/point relative to the current heading/position
        async               Do not wait for the robot to settle before finishing execution
        nopid, thru         Do not use PID for this movemnet. All PID args are ignored

        maxSpeed            Sets the maximum speed for this movement

        exitAngle           Sets the maximum angle that counts for angular settlement

settle
    Pauses the current thread until the robot finishes it's current movement

pid linear (tuple)
    Sets the global PID constants to use for linear movements

pid angular (tuple)
    Sets the global PID constants to use for angular movmenets

setpose (pose)
    Sets the robots current pose. This allows the user to reset the odometry with
    different coordinate systems
