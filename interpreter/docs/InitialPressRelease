## NOTICE:
(PROS_SHELL) is still under it's alpha stages. These releases are intended to test the template and gain feedback on it's design. Features, syntax, and functionality are not set in stone. Future versions will likely break certain things in an effort to improve the template as a whole. Version 1.0.0 will mark the first stable release where compatability will not be broken.

_I am aiming for the first stable release to occur shortly after worlds_

## What's new in version 0.1.0
- Basic Commands:
    - record start and stop
    - run files from SD card
    - wait a specifiedtime
- User Defined Commands
- Template Support:
  - ARMS
  
## What is (PROS_SHELL)
(PROS_SHELL) is a PROS template that adds a custom scripting/shell-like environment to your robot. You can:
- Type commands into the PROS terminal to tell your robot to do things
- Pipe files into the terminal to run programs saved in text files
- Record commands to the robot's SD card and play them back for testing, or for competition
- Add your own commands to suite the needs of your robot

Here is an example of what your autons could look like using (PROS_SHELL). 
```py
# Move to an optimal position to shoot our matchloads
goto (24in, 24in) maxSpeed=80 exitRadius=0.5in

# Face the goal so we can shoot at it
face (128, 64) exitAngle=3.5deg

# Shoot 2 discs into the goal
flywheel shoot 2
```
